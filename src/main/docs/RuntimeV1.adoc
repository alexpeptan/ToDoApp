First version is an extremely simple Docker setup:
--
* a single Docker host per environment
* Jenkins stops and runs the application 
  (this means downtime)
* there is no load balancing
* application is accessed by docker host IP 
  (consequence of no load balancing)
* application does not persist any data because DB
  is being embedded along with the application. Also,
  there is no data migration

Based on list above, we are essentially defining 
an _ephemeral environment_, that has no state and can be
removed anytime.
